# ASSIGNMENT NO: 3

Dear Students,

All are instructed to complete C program for solving the following problems with following format

-	AIM
-	ALGORITHM
-	PROGRAM
-	SAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT
-	RESULT

## PROGRAMS IN C DATATYPES

1.	Accept character as an input from the user. Print the corresponding ASCII value as output. 
2.	Accept ASCII value as an input from the user. Print the corresponding character as output. 
3.	Write a C program to get float data type as input and print the output as integer data type.
4.	Jithin goes to coffee shop and orders a coffee and a samosa. Write a C program to accept price of coffee and samosa as input and print the sum as output with the precision up to two decimal places
5.	Raghu and his friends (total 4 persons) work on a project and receive Rs.89507 as profit. Write a C program to accept the profit as input and output each person’s share as an output.
6.	Write a program to get the students detail and display it.
7.	The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption technique. It’s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. Write a C program to get a character as input and print its corresponding cipher (use 3 as shift key).
8.	Accept two integers as input. Perform division operation on those numbers and print the answer with / without float type conversion. 
9.	Write a C program to accept a character as input and print its 3 consecutive characters as output. 
10.	Accept an integer and a character as inputs. Add the integer to the character variable and output the result in character and integer data type.
